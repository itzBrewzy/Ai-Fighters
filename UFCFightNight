    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application transforms the linear, text-heavy source report into a non-linear, interactive dashboard. The structure is designed for user-driven exploration rather than passive reading. It prioritizes quick access to key predictions on the main card (landing view), with a central interactive "Full Fight Card" section that acts as a navigation hub. Clicking any fight reveals a detailed modal view with visualizations and analysis. This query-based model (user pulls info on demand) is more efficient and engaging for the target audience (fans, bettors) than scrolling through a long document. The structure is composed of: 1) A high-impact header. 2) A "Main Event" focus section. 3) An interactive "Full Fight Card" list that serves as the primary navigation tool. 4) A modal window for detailed, on-demand analysis of any selected fight. This architecture makes the dense data highly consumable and allows users to compare fights easily without losing context. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The choices below support the interactive dashboard structure by transforming static data into dynamic, easily digestible visuals. All visualizations are rendered on Canvas via Chart.js, adhering to the NO SVG constraint.

- Report Info: Fighter stats (SLpM, Accuracy, etc.). -> Goal: Compare. -> Viz: Radar Chart. -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips. -> Justification: Provides a holistic "shape" of a fighter's style, making it easy to see strengths and weaknesses at a glance. -> Library: Chart.js.
- Report Info: Betting Odds (Text). -> Goal: Inform. -> Viz: Simple Horizontal Bar Chart. -> Interaction: Static display with data labels. -> Justification: Translates numerical odds into a clear visual representation of market favorability. -> Library: Chart.js.
- Report Info: Full Fight Card (Table). -> Goal: Organize/Navigate. -> Viz: Interactive HTML/CSS list. -> Interaction: Click to open a modal with detailed analysis. -> Justification: Serves as the core interactive hub, allowing users to efficiently access deep information for any fight. -> Library: Vanilla JS.
- Report Info: Prediction Outcome (Text). -> Goal: Inform. -> Viz: Styled HTML badges with icons (🥊, 🥋, 📜). -> Interaction: Static display. -> Justification: Provides an immediate, scannable visual summary of the predicted outcome for each fight. -> Library: HTML/Tailwind CSS. -->

        weightClass: "Heavyweight (Main Event)",
        prediction: { winner: "Tallison Teixeira", method: "TKO", round: 1 },
        analysis: "Teixeira's undefeated record, 100% first-round finishing rate, and significant physical advantages (height, reach, 15-year age gap) create a compelling case for an early victory. While Lewis's power is legendary, his age and recent vulnerability to aggressive, powerful opponents suggest he will struggle with Teixeira's relentless pressure from the opening bell. The market consensus heavily favors an early stoppage for the Brazilian prospect.",

        weightClass: "Welterweight (Co-Main)",
        prediction: { winner: "Gabriel Bonfim", method: "Submission", round: 2 },
        analysis: "This is a classic striker vs. grappler matchup. Bonfim's aggressive, submission-heavy style and high takedown accuracy directly target Thompson's primary weakness. At 42, 'Wonderboy' will likely find it difficult to defend takedowns for 15 minutes against a younger, relentless opponent with 13 submission wins. Bonfim is expected to get the fight to the mat and find a finish.",

        prediction: { winner: "Steve Garcia", method: "TKO", round: 2 },
        analysis: "Garcia is riding a massive wave of momentum with five straight knockout wins. While Kattar is a skilled boxer, he's on a four-fight losing streak and has reportedly declined since a knee injury. Garcia's power, pressure, and confidence will likely overwhelm the veteran, leading to another stoppage victory for the 'Mean Machine'.",

        prediction: { winner: "Morgan Charriere", method: "Decision", round: 3 },
        analysis: "Charriere's well-rounded skillset, blending clean striking with a formidable grappling background (Judo & Luta Livre black belts), gives him more ways to win. Landwehr's 'savage' pressure is dangerous, but he absorbs a lot of damage. Charriere's fight IQ should allow him to counter-strike effectively and mix in takedowns to control the fight and secure a decision.",

        prediction: { winner: "Vitor Petrino", method: "TKO", round: 2 },
        analysis: "Although Petrino is debuting at Heavyweight and giving up size, he is the more technical and well-rounded fighter. His blend of powerful striking and solid wrestling should allow him to dictate the fight. Lane has knockout power but has also been susceptible to being knocked out himself. Petrino's superior skill set should prevail.",

        prediction: { winner: "Junior Tafa", method: "TKO", round: 1 },
        analysis: "This matchup heavily favors Tafa's raw power. All six of his wins have come by knockout. Facing Tokkos, who is on a three-fight losing skid, Tafa's 'Juggernaut' style is perfectly positioned to secure another early, decisive finish.",

        weightClass: "Welterweight",
        prediction: { winner: "Chris Curtis", method: "Decision", round: 3 },
        analysis: "Curtis returns to Welterweight, a move he feels confident about. Known for his high-volume striking and 'action-man' brawling style, he should be able to outwork Griffin. His excellent takedown defense will likely keep the fight standing, where his pace and pressure will win him the rounds.",

        weightClass: "Welterweight",
        prediction: { winner: "Chidi Njokuani", method: "TKO", round: 1 },
        analysis: "Njokuani's significant height and reach advantage, combined with his 'kill or be killed' striking style, makes him a huge threat. Matthews is tough, but Njokuani's power and accuracy often lead to early finishes. Expect 'Chidi Bang Bang' to live up to his name and find an opening in the first round.",

        prediction: { winner: "Eduarda Moura", method: "Submission", round: 1 },
        analysis: "This is a classic 'passing of the torch' fight. Murphy is 42, returning from a two-year layoff for her retirement fight. Moura is a young, aggressive grappler with a high takedown rate and perfect takedown defense. Expect Moura to dominate from the start, taking the fight to the ground for a quick submission.",

        analysis: "While Walker has solid wrestling, Nzechukwu's excellent 81% takedown defense is a strong counter. This fight is likely to stay on the feet, where Nzechukwu's higher striking volume and proven knockout power should give him a clear advantage over three rounds, leading to a decision victory.",

Kline will get this fight to the mat and work for a submission.",
